## 1. Deposit Collateral
First, a user deposits their crypto assets, such as Ethereum (ETH), into a **Concrete Vault**. In return, Concrete issues a receipt token, like **Concrete ETH (cETH)**, which acts as proof of the deposit. This token can now be used within the platform.

## 2. Borrow Against Collateral
With your receipt token (cETH) in hand, you can borrow stablecoins like USDT or other assets. You use your cETH as collateral to initiate the loan. The Concrete platform will automatically find the best borrowing rate from integrated money markets, ensuring you get the most favorable terms.

## 3. Leveraging the Loan**
Once you receive your borrowed assets, you are free to use them in any way you wishâ€”whether that's buying more crypto, reinvesting, or utilizing them in other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.

## 4. Liquidation Protection
One of the key differentiators of Concrete is its liquidation protection. Unlike other DeFi platforms, Concrete offers multiple layers of protection, including **Concrete Lite** and **Concrete Protect**, which automatically monitor your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. If your collateral value starts to drop and you approach the liquidation threshold, Concrete steps in before liquidation occurs, minimizing penalties and helping you retain more of your assets.

## 5. Repay and Withdraw
To get your original ETH deposit back, you must first repay the loan. Once the loan is paid off, you can swap back your cETH for ETH and withdraw it from the vault. This step ensures your assets remain fully accessible once all obligations are cleared.
