## Concrete Borrow (Lite)

Concrete Borrow (Lite) is the foundational borrowing solution in the Concrete ecosystem, providing users with a streamlined experience and default protection against liquidation.

By default, Concrete Borrow comes with **Concrete Lite**, which forecloses loans early, reducing the risk of liquidation penalties:

- **Early Foreclosure**: If the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio approaches the liquidation threshold, Concrete Lite triggers an early foreclosure, avoiding traditional liquidation.
- **Reduced Fees**: This process incurs a **3.5% foreclosure fee**, significantly lower than typical market liquidation penalties (5%-15%).
- **No Activation Fee**: Concrete Borrow (Lite) is active by default, with no upfront costs.
- **Gas Fee Subsidy**: Borrowers receive partial coverage for gas fees when taking out loans through Concrete.
