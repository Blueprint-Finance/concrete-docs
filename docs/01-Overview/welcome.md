Welcome to **Concrete.xyz**, a DeFi platform that allows you to **borrow**, **protect**, and **earn** on your crypto assets while benefiting from capital efficiency, liquidity protection, and yield optimization across multiple chains.

Concrete integrates with multiple lending platforms, allowing users to tap into the best yields and borrowing rates across different protocols. Users can deposit their assets once and Concrete takes care of rebalancing between different money markets as conditions change.

## Users

* **Borrowers** seeking protection from liquidation with Concrete's *Probability Engine*, which protects against liquidation by automatically injecting credit
* **Liquidity Providers** aiming for yield maximization with **Earn Vaults**, which automate the process of finding and deploying liquidity to the highest-yielding opportunities in the DeFi space without constant manual reallocation.
* **Traders** hunting for market opportunities and profiting from the best rates across integrated DeFi platforms.

## Why Concrete?

**Concrete** stands out from traditional DeFi platforms by automating yield generation, providing robust liquidation protection, and enabling cross-chain liquidity management. It caters to both conservative and aggressive investors with its range of passive and leveraged strategies, while also supporting decentralized innovation through community-driven vaults. As the platform evolves, it aims to address the key limitations of DeFi by providing seamless asset management and optimized returns across different blockchains.

- **Best Rates**: Access competitive market terms for borrowing.
- **Lower fees**: Foreclose positions early, helping users avoid the 15%+ fees typically charged by other platforms.
- **Protection Policies**: Purchase protection plans that offer **multiple levels of defense** against liquidation to safeguard your assets during market downturns.
- **High-yield strategies**, for earning returns on assets without users needing to manage the process themselves.
- **Borrowing against your vault deposits** with minimized risks of liquidation, thanks to multi-level liquidation protection.
- **Integration with multiple money markets**, allowing for optimization of both returns and borrowing rates.
- **Automatic debt servicing**, using the yield generated by the assets to cover borrowing costs, making the process hands-free for the user.

## Limitations in Current DeFi Solutions

In the world of crypto, users often face complexities like navigating multiple networks, choosing the best yields, and managing risks of liquidation. Concrete allows users to earn high yields, borrow against their assets, and mitigate liquidation risks through advanced mechanisms.

### Fragmentation and Lack of Cross-Chain Functionality

Current DeFi platforms operate largely within isolated ecosystems. Users face challenges in accessing the best yields across various blockchains and protocols.

### Risk of Liquidation

Traditional DeFi protocols often expose users to high liquidation risks. When an asset's value drops below a certain threshold, liquidation penalties can result in significant losses.

### Complex Yield Management

DeFi users must frequently monitor different platforms to find and maintain the best returns.

### Limited Capital Inflows
Despite the vast potential of traditional finance markets, DeFi has struggled to attract large institutional investors due to inadequate risk management and trust mechanisms.

## How Concrete Solves These Limitations

### 1. Liquidation Protection with Concrete Lite and Protect

Concrete addresses the risks of liquidation through its **Probability Engine**, which forecasts when a loan might reach its liquidation threshold. **Concrete Lite** reduces liquidation penalties, while **Concrete Protect** injects additional capital into the loan to prevent liquidation altogether, safeguarding user assets from volatile market conditions.

### 2. Automated and Advanced Yield Strategies

Concrete's vaults operate based on the **ERC-4626 standard**, enabling users to deposit assets into **Earn Vaults** that are automatically allocated to the best-performing money markets. The platform seamlessly rebalances assets between protocols like Aave and Compound, making yield optimization automatic and hands-free for the user.

- **Rebalancing Between Markets**: For example, if Aave is offering a 9% APY and Compound only 4%, Concrete will allocate funds to Aave. If Compound later increases its APY to 12%, the platform will move assets to Compound, ensuring that the user's funds are always earning the highest possible return without manual intervention.

- **Vanilla Lending Strategy**: Concrete employs a low-risk strategy where user assets are lent out to established platforms to generate passive income. This foundational approach is ideal for users seeking stable returns (typically 2â€“3%) without engaging in complex DeFi strategies.

### 3. Leveraged Yield and Flash Loans

In addition to passive income, Concrete offers leveraged yield strategies, where liquidity from earn vaults is used for flash loans or capital disbursements. The protocol generates revenue through fees charged on these transactions, amplifying returns for users.

### 4. Cross-Chain Liquidity Management

Concrete's hub-and-spoke architecture allows users to manage liquidity across multiple blockchains, overcoming the typical fragmentation in DeFi ecosystems. Users will be able to deposit assets on one chain (e.g., Ethereum) and borrow against them on another (e.g., Avalanche), ensuring liquidity is used in the most effective way across platforms.
