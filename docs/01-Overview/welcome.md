Welcome to **Concrete.xyz**, a DeFi platform that allows you to **borrow**, **protect**, and **earn** on your crypto assets while benefiting from capital efficiency, liquidity protection, and yield optimization across multiple chains. Concrete integrates with multiple lending platforms, allowing users to tap into the best yields and borrowing rates across different protocols. Users can deposit their assets once and Concrete takes care of rebalancing between different money markets as conditions change.

## Users

* **Borrowers** seeking protection from liquidation with Concrete's *Probability Engine*, which protects against liquidation by automatically injecting credit
* **Liquidity Providers** aiming for yield maximization with **Earn Vaults**, which automate the process of finding and deploying liquidity to the highest-yielding opportunities in the DeFi space without constant manual reallocation.
* **Traders** hunting for market opportunities and profiting from the best rates across integrated DeFi platforms.

## Limitations in Current DeFi Solutions

In the world of crypto, users often face complexities like navigating multiple networks, choosing the best yields, and managing risks of liquidation. Concrete allows users to earn high yields, borrow against their assets, and mitigate liquidation risks through advanced mechanisms.

### Fragmentation and Lack of Cross-Chain Functionality

Current DeFi platforms operate largely within isolated ecosystems. Users face challenges in accessing the best yields across various blockchains and protocols. Concrete resolves this by developing a hub-and-spoke architecture, allowing cross-chain liquidity management in future iterations. This enables seamless access to the best opportunities across multiple chains, overcoming the isolation of individual ecosystems.

### Risk of Liquidation
Traditional DeFi protocols often expose users to high liquidation risks. When an asset's value drops below a certain threshold, liquidation penalties can result in significant losses. **Concrete’s Loan Protect** and **Concrete Lite** products introduce advanced liquidation protection mechanisms that inject capital to prevent liquidation events, reducing collateral loss and allowing users to maintain their positions longer, even during volatile market conditions.

### Complex Yield Management
DeFi users must frequently monitor different platforms to find and maintain the best returns. **Concrete automates** this process, managing liquidity across multiple money markets like Aave and Compound. The platform rebalances user funds to optimize yields automatically, freeing users from the need to actively manage their assets.

### Limited Capital Inflows
Despite the vast potential of traditional finance markets, DeFi has struggled to attract large institutional investors due to inadequate risk management and trust mechanisms. Concrete’s **Probability Engine** and sophisticated risk models create a more robust infrastructure, instilling confidence and creating opportunities for larger capital inflows.

## Why Concrete?

- **Best Rates**: Access competitive market terms for borrowing.
- **Lower fees**: Foreclose positions early, helping users avoid the 15%+ fees typically charged by other platforms.
- **Protection Policies**: Purchase protection plans that offer **multiple levels of defense** against liquidation to safeguard your assets during market downturns.
- **High-yield strategies**, for earning returns on assets without users needing to manage the process themselves.
- **Borrowing against your vault deposits** with minimized risks of liquidation, thanks to multi-level liquidation protection.
- **Integration with multiple money markets**, allowing for optimization of both returns and borrowing rates.
- **Automatic debt servicing**, using the yield generated by the assets to cover borrowing costs, making the process hands-free for the user.

## How Concrete Stands Apart

### 1. Sophisticated Risk Management
Concrete's Probability Engine and multi-level liquidation protection address the high risk of liquidation seen in other platforms. These tools calculate the likelihood of liquidation and proactively manage risk to preserve user capital.

### 2. Cross-Chain Liquidity Access
Concrete plans to introduce cross-chain asset management, allowing users to deposit assets on one chain and borrow or earn on another, greatly enhancing liquidity and earning potential across blockchains.

### 3. User-Friendly Automation
By integrating with multiple money markets and offering automated rebalancing of funds, Concrete eliminates the need for manual monitoring and adjustments, unlike most existing DeFi platforms.
