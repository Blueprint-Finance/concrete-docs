Before diving into the Concrete Protocol, ensure the following items are set up and ready to use:

1. **Ethereum Wallet**: You'll need a Web3-compatible wallet such as **MetaMask**. These wallets will store your funds and interact with the Concrete dApp.
2. **ETH for Gas Fees**: Make sure your wallet has sufficient **ETH** to cover gas fees for transactions like deposits, withdrawals, or interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The exact amount depends on network activity, so ensure to have some extra ETH available.

## How to Use Concrete

### 1. Launch the Concrete dApp  
   Head to the official **Concrete website** and launch the decentralized app (dApp). You can browse the app and view the features available to you, but you will need to connect your wallet for full access.

### 2. Connect Your Wallet
   To access Concrete's core features (borrow, earn, manage), you'll need to authenticate by connecting your wallet.  
   - Click on the **Connect Wallet** button.
   - Select your wallet provider (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.).
   - Sign the message in your wallet to authenticate.

### 3. Accept Terms & Conditions  
   Before you proceed, you will be required to read and accept the terms and conditions. This is a mandatory step to ensure legal compliance when using the protocol.

### 4. Explore the Dashboards
   Once your wallet is connected and terms accepted, you'll be directed to Concrete's main dashboard. Here, you can access key features like:
   - **Borrow**: Find the most favorable borrowing positions.
   - **Earn**: Deposit assets to earn yields in Concreteâ€™s vaults.
   - **Portfolio**: Track your borrowing positions, vault deposits, and rewards.
