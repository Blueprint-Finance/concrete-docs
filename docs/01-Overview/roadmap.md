Concrete's roadmap includes robust plans for cross-chain liquidity and asset management, to be implemented across different stages:

## V1
All liquidity remains localized within a specific blockchain, with no cross-chain movement allowed.

## V2
Users will be able to swap assets within the same blockchain ecosystem, facilitating smoother transitions between vaults without external trading.

## V3
Cross-chain lending will be introduced, allowing users to deposit assets on one blockchain and borrow against them on another.

## V4
Full cross-chain liquidity management will enable users to consolidate assets and borrow across multiple connected blockchains.
