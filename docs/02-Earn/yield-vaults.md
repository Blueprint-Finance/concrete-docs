Concrete operates vaults based on the **ERC-4626 standard**, supporting major assets like **BTC**, **ETH**, and **USDT**. These vaults allow users to deposit assets, borrow against them, and earn returns through automated strategies. By utilizing the ERC-4626 standard, Concrete ensures smooth compatibility between assets and protocols, facilitating seamless interaction within the DeFi ecosystem. This design also lays the foundation for future expansions, with plans to include **liquid staking tokens (LSTs)** and other assets over time, broadening the range of investment opportunities for users.
