**Concrete** is designed to help users optimize yield generation from the moment they deposit assets. But how your dollar works on **Day One** and how it evolves by **Day 500** reflects the growing complexity and opportunities within the ecosystem.

## Day One: Laying the Foundation for Yield and Security

### 1. Deposit into a 4626 Vault

On **Day One**, your journey starts when you deposit an asset (e.g., ETH, BTC, USDC) into a 4626 vault. This vault is a specialized structure designed to streamline investment processes while ensuring compatibility with other protocols. You don’t need to take any action beyond depositing—the system is built to automate the most efficient strategies.

### 2. Passive Yield Generation

Once your asset is in the vault, Concrete employs sophisticated strategies to seek the best yield opportunities available in various crypto markets. For example, your funds might be allocated to money markets like Aave or Compound, where the protocol identifies the highest risk-adjusted returns. The entire process is handled seamlessly by Concrete’s backend, eliminating the need for you to manually move assets around or keep track of yield rates across different platforms.

Over time, your assets accrue yield. Concrete allows you to periodically claim the rewards generated from the automated strategies. The yield from your assets can be used to automatically compound or be withdrawn at any time, leaving users to profit from the remaining yield while maintaining liquidity.

### 3. Borrowing and Protection — *Only in Future Features*

While **Concrete Earn V2** currently focuses on yield generation and vault management, upcoming roadmap phases may include **Concrete Borrow** and **Concrete Protect** to enable users to borrow against deposited assets and access advanced liquidation safeguards.

In future iterations:

* **Borrow** will allow users to unlock liquidity without withdrawing assets.
* **Protect** will offer optional liquidation protection to guard against market volatility.

These features are not yet active but remain part of Concrete’s long-term product vision.

### 4. Simple Fee Structure

On the first day, you begin incurring standard fees like **Yield fees** (a small percentage of profits, typically around 2%).

## Day 500: A Growing Set of Opportunities

By **Day 500**, your dollar has evolved within a more complex and dynamic ecosystem. The platform has expanded its offerings, and you can now take advantage of additional tools that were unavailable on Day One.

### 1. Advanced Yield Strategies

Beyond the simple money market yields from Day One, by Day 500, Concrete offers more sophisticated strategies. These may include community-driven vaults created by users who specialize in advanced yield tactics or leveraged yield strategies that can potentially generate higher returns (though they may come with higher risk).

These strategies offer more lucrative returns compared to the passive methods of Day One, but they require more liquidity or involve more complex risk management.

### 2. Cross-Chain Asset Management

As the platform matures, cross-chain functionality becomes available. Concrete will enable users to interact with assets across different chains and manage liquidity seamlessly — creating **cross-chain liquidity management** capabilities that integrate directly with Earn vaults.

### 3. Swapping Assets Within Concrete

A built-in asset swap feature enables you to shift your holdings from one asset to another (e.g., swapping ETH for BTC) without leaving the platform.

### 4. Integration with Community-Driven Money Markets

Community-built money markets will offer higher yield opportunities but might involve greater risks or liquidity challenges. Additionally, Ecosystem ETFs—diversified portfolios spread across multiple protocols—allow for more balanced yet optimized strategies for returns.

The system has evolved into a **decentralized competition market**, where users can create vaults with their own strategies, and Concrete can select the best ones to integrate into the platform.

### 5. Automatic Rebalancing

Concrete integrates automated asset management and rebalancing, using the yield generated from the assets you’ve deposited to optimize capital efficiency. This ensures that users never have to worry about manually managing allocations or compounding yield. The system continuously manages vault performance while maintaining transparency and security.

## How Concrete Makes Money

### Yield Fees

For each yield-generating strategy that Concrete executes on your behalf, a small percentage of the profits (typically around 2%) is paid to the protocol as a **service fee**. This incentivizes Concrete to consistently find the most efficient yield-generating opportunities for its users.

## Example Journey

Imagine you deposit **1 ETH** into Concrete on **Day One**. Concrete immediately places your ETH into its vaults, actively seeking the highest risk-adjusted returns through lending protocols like Aave or Compound. You earn passive yield on your deposit, and Concrete handles all the research and market movements.

Over time, as your assets accrue yield and the market evolves, Concrete’s automated system continuously compounds your returns and optimizes allocations, leaving you to profit from the growing yield without manual intervention.

By **Day 500**, you’ve accumulated more ETH in returns and have options to diversify your investments through cross-chain liquidity management or move your assets to another protocol through Concrete’s built-in asset swap feature. Additionally, you could explore higher-risk, community-driven yield strategies to potentially boost your returns even further.

Throughout the process, Concrete handles everything—from rebalancing your assets to maintaining accurate accounting—while ensuring that your deposits are safe and optimally managed.
