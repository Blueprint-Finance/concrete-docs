Welcome to [Concrete.xyz](https://www.concrete.xyz), a suite of DeFi products powering secure, automated yield strategies and unlocking new derivatives for any on-chain asset. Earn the highest rate of return, borrow anywhere without liquidation, trade the risk.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) comes with complexities that require users to "Do Your Own Research" (DYOR) before engaging. From navigating multiple platforms for the best yields to securing your assets against liquidation, DeFi can feel overwhelming for both new and experienced users.

[Launch Concrete App](https://app.concrete.xyz/earn) and deposit to vaults to earn the highest yield on your assets.

## Designed For

* **Borrowers** seeking protection from liquidation.
* **Liquidity Providers** aiming for yield maximization.
* **Traders** hunting for market opportunities and profiting from the best rates across integrated DeFi platforms.

## How Concrete Stands Apart from Traditional DeFi Solutions

* Concrete’s liquidation protection is unmatched. Traditional DeFi solutions may let users get liquidated once thresholds are crossed, but Concrete steps in before liquidation hits.

* Instead of users hopping between different money markets, Concrete automatically moves your assets to the best-performing protocols, ensuring maximum yield with zero effort on your part.

* Many DeFi platforms are fragmented across different blockchains. Concrete provides a unified user experience across multiple chains.

## Why Concrete?

Concrete’s value proposition lies in how it addresses common DeFi challenges in a simple and automated way. While other platforms leave users vulnerable to liquidation risks, force them to chase yields manually, and provide fragmented experiences across different chains, Concrete unifies all of these features into one platform.

### 1. Easy to Use
For many users, DeFi requires connecting to multiple platforms, understanding complex protocols, and constantly monitoring market conditions. Concrete eliminates this complexity by offering a streamlined user experience. Whether you're looking to earn, borrow, or protect your assets, Concrete automates these tasks for you. The interface is designed so users don’t have to worry about switching between networks or applications. Concrete brings DeFi on easy mode, allowing users to focus on their strategies while the platform handles the execution.

### 2. Best Yields to Earn
Yield farming in DeFi often involves searching through numerous protocols to find the highest returns, but this introduces risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and liquidity issues. Concrete’s Earn Vaults automate yield optimization, continuously reallocating your assets to the highest-yielding opportunities across multiple protocols.

Integration with multiple money markets, allowing users to tap into the best yields and borrowing rates across different protocols. Users can deposit their assets once and Concrete takes care of rebalancing between different money markets as conditions change.

### 3. Protection Against Liquidation
A major fear in the DeFi world is the risk of liquidation when borrowing against your assets. Traditionally, when the value of your collateral drops below a certain threshold, your position gets liquidated, and you lose a significant portion of your assets. Concrete eliminates this fear by offering multi-layered liquidation protection through its **Concrete Lite** and **Concrete Protect**. The system actively monitors your position, injects credit if needed, and ensures you avoid the full brunt of liquidation penalties.

### 4. Leveraging Long-term Assets
Users often want liquidity for short-term needs while holding onto long-term assets like Ethereum. With Concrete, you can easily borrow stablecoins or other assets against your deposits without worrying about liquidation risks. Whether you need liquidity for new investments or just want to use your holdings without selling them, Concrete allows you to do this with peace of mind. The platform handles the complexities, ensuring you get the best borrowing rates and protection.

## A Real-World Analogy

Imagine you own a house, which represents your Ethereum (ETH) deposit. Concrete steps in and finds a tenant for you, ensuring you earn rental income—this is akin to the yield Concrete helps you generate from your crypto assets. To prove you own the house and that it's generating income, Concrete gives you a lease agreement—this is your Concrete token (ctETH), which acts as a receipt for your deposit.

Now, let's say you need to borrow money for an investment, but you don’t want to sell your house. Concrete allows you to borrow stablecoins (like USDT) against the lease agreement (ctETH). You get access to the funds without having to sell your long-term asset. If you want to get your house (ETH) back, all you need to do is pay off the loan and return the lease agreement (ctETH).

Meanwhile, Concrete continuously monitors the market for you. If the value of your house (ETH) drops, Concrete steps in to ensure you aren’t liquidated, protecting your investment until the market stabilizes.
