Before diving into the Concrete Protocol, ensure the following items are set up and ready to use:

## 1. Ethereum Wallet

You'll need a Web3-compatible wallet such as **MetaMask**. These wallets will store your funds and interact with the Concrete dApp.

## 2. ETH for Gas Fees

Make sure your wallet has sufficient **ETH** to cover gas fees for transactions like deposits, withdrawals, or interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The exact amount depends on network activity, so ensure to have some extra ETH available.
