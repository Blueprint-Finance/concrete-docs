### 1. Launch the Concrete dApp  
   Head to the official **Concrete website** and launch the decentralized app (dApp). You can browse the app and view the features available to you, but you will need to connect your wallet for full access.

### 2. Connect Your Wallet
   To access Concrete's core features (borrow, earn, manage), you'll need to authenticate by connecting your wallet.  
   - Click on the **Connect Wallet** button.
   - Select your wallet provider (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.).
   - Sign the message in your wallet to authenticate.

### 3. Accept Terms & Conditions  
   Before you proceed, you will be required to read and accept the terms and conditions. This is a mandatory step to ensure legal compliance when using the protocol.

### 4. Explore the Dashboards
   Once your wallet is connected and terms accepted, you'll be directed to Concrete's main dashboard. Here, you can access key features like:
   - **Borrow**: Find the most favorable borrowing positions.
   - **Earn**: Deposit assets to earn yields in Concrete’s vaults.
   - **Portfolio**: Track your borrowing positions, vault deposits, and rewards.

## **Earn**

The **Earn** dashboard within the Concrete Protocol enables users to deposit and lock their assets to earn the highest possible yield with optimized strategies.

Here's how you can navigate and utilize the Earn feature to maximize your returns.

### Key Insights of the Earn Dashboard

**Total Deposited**: Displays the total value of assets you've deposited in various yield-generating vaults.

### How to Use the Earn Dashboard

1. **View Available Vaults**:  
   Within the Earn dashboard, you will be able to browse all available vaults for your specific assets. Each vault is associated with a different lending provider (e.g., **Aave**, **Compound**, etc.) and presents varying yield opportunities.

2. **Explore Optimal Yields**:  
   The dashboard allows you to explore yields offered by different lenders, enabling you to find the most favorable return for your assets. You can also filter these options based on the blockchain network (e.g., **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**).

3. **Deposit Your Assets**:  
   Once you’ve found the optimal vault, you can deposit your assets directly into it to start earning yield. The deposited assets are locked in the vault, generating returns based on the chosen strategy and protocol.

4. **Monitor Your Earnings**:  
   The dashboard will continuously display updated information about your deposited assets, the vault’s performance, and how much yield you've earned over time.

## Portfolio Dashboard

The **Portfolio** dashboard allows you to track and manage your activity within the Concrete Protocol. It focuses on three main objectives:

1. **Positions**: Displays all your active and closed positions, both for borrowing and earning.
2. **Vaults**: Lets you manage your deposits into vaults. You can add or withdraw assets, and adjust your investment strategy as needed.
3. **Rewards**: Displays all the rewards you've earned through participating in Concrete's earning and borrowing mechanisms. These rewards typically include **CT Tokens**, which can be claimed directly from the dashboard.

## Borrow

The **Borrow** dashboard is designed to help you find the best lending positions from various lending protocols (e.g., **Aave**, **Compound**, etc.). Concrete automatically scans the network for the most optimal annual percentage yield (APY) based on your chosen asset.

Key insights provided within the Borrow dashboard include:

- **Total Collateral Deposited**: Displays the total value of assets you've deposited into the protocol as collateral.
- **Total Borrowed**: Shows the total amount of assets you've borrowed.
- **Average LTV (Loan-to-Value)**: Displays the average LTV ratio across all your active borrowing positions.
- **Active Positions**: Indicates the total number of borrowing positions open across the Concrete platform.

### Core Borrowing Interaction

In the **Borrow** dashboard, you can manage your borrowing and collateral activities using the selector in the center:

1. **Select the Collateral Asset**: Choose the asset you wish to deposit as collateral (e.g., ETH, BTC).
2. **Select the Borrowed Asset**: Choose the asset you'd like to borrow (e.g., USDC, DAI).
3. **Choose Your Network**: Select your preferred blockchain network from those supported by Concrete, such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Polygon.

Once you select these options, Concrete will display various **Open Positions** with details such as APR, LTV, and potential liquidation thresholds. You can select one of these positions to initiate borrowing.
