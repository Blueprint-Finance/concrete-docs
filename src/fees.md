Before diving into the specifics of each service, hereâ€™s a quick look at the main fee types users will encounter across Concrete Protocol services:

- **Foreclosure Fee**: Applied only when foreclosure is required; it replaces traditional liquidation penalties.
- **Claim Fee**: Charged per credit line disbursement (up to 3)
- **Cancellation Fee**: Set to zero, allowing users to cancel services early without penalty.
- **Deposit, Maintenance, and Withdrawal Fees**: Applied in traditional finance settings but waived in Concrete Earn, maximizing returns for liquidity providers.
