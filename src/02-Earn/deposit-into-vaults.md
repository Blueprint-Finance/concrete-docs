## Step 2: Initiate Deposit

- Click the **Deposit** tab.
- Enter the amount of the asset you want to deposit (e.g., 3.2 ETH).
   - The interface calculates and shows:
     - The equivalent receipt token (e.g., cETH).
     - Deposit value in USD.
     - Expected earnings in both cETH and rewards.

## Step 3: Confirm Deposit

Review details in the **Deposit Collateral** model:
   - Collateral value.
   - Updated **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** ratio.
   - Improved **Liquidation Price** for added security.

## Step 4: Verify Deposit in Portfolio

Once confirmed on the blockchain, the updated holdings will be visible:
  - Your **Portfolio** will show the newly deposited assets.
  - Corresponding receipt tokens (e.g., cETH) reflect your vault balance.
