If you previously deposited into a Concrete Movement vault, your position has now been migrated to **Canopy**‚Äîbut your funds are still yours.

:::tip
To interact with Canopy, you‚Äôll need a **Movement Wallet** (OKX Wallet, Nightly or Razor). If you don‚Äôt already have one, follow the official setup guide üîó [How to connect to Movement](https://docs.movementnetwork.xyz/general/UsingMovement/connect_to_movement). Once your Movement wallet is ready, return to Canopy and proceed to the next step.
:::

Follow this quick guide to access your position on Canopy and claim your rewards.

## 1. Go to Canopy

Navigate to the [Explore](https://app.canopyhub.xyz/explore) tab in the top navigation bar to view your vaults.

## 5. **Withdraw and Claim Rewards**

When your vault is unlocked, you can **withdraw your original assets and claim rewards**.

- After creating a MOVE address, you‚Äôll see your eligible rewards
- Canopy will issue you an **LP token** representing your vault position
- You can then claim any available rewards directly through the Canopy interface
- Confirm the claim transaction in your wallet

:::tip
Withdrawals from some vaults‚Äîsuch as Corn vaults‚Äîwill be enabled approximately 2‚Äì3 weeks after launch. Once available, a **cooldown period of up to 72 hours** may apply. This ensures secure redemptions and proper syncing with backend contracts. Cooldown periods are being adopted as a standard feature across all vaults to improve protocol safety and redemption predictability.

If no rewards are available yet, you‚Äôll see a message indicating when they will be.

## What About Concrete Points?

Your **ctMove tokens** stay in your wallet.

These tokens represent your share of future Concrete rewards.

- Concrete Points are **not claimable yet**
- Once a **Token Generation Event (TGE)** happens, you‚Äôll be able to redeem your points
- You'll need to return to the **Concrete app** to claim them when that time comes
