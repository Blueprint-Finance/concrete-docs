## Concrete Points Program: Phase 1 (Social Campaign)

Welcome to the **Concrete Points Program, Phase 1!**

This initial phase is designed to reward community engagement and future rewards phases.

Phase 1 is a **social campaign** where users complete quests to earn **"bags."**

[This campaign is powered by **Absinthe**.](https://boost.absinthe.network/z2zi-tzc2/home)

### Bags and Points

- **Earning Bags:** Users earn bags by participating in various qualified quests.
- **Conversion to Points:** At a later date, these bags will be converted into **Concrete Points**.
- **Conversion Ratio:** The exact conversion ratio (from bags to points) will be released later.

### The Leaderboard

The platform includes a **Leaderboard tab** to track user performance. You must Connect your wallet to view your XP and Connect your wallet to view your rank.

### Step-by-Step Participation

To begin earning, you must first connect your accounts on the Absinthe platform.

#### 1. Connection and Identity Management

- **Connection:** Look for the **Connect** button at the top right of the homepage.
- **Manage Connections:** Use the Linked Accounts tab to Manage Your Connections. You can connect various wallets and social accounts to enhance your experience. Sign in to view and manage your connected identities.

#### 2. Complete Social Actions

The rewards are earned purely through social actions and are **not** related to using the Earn App at this time.

Examples of qualifying Social Actions can include but are not limited to:

- **Following Concrete on X:** Stay updated on the latest developments from Concrete Protocol and Blueprint team (https://x.com/ConcreteXYZ).
- **Joining the Concrete Discord:** Dive into discussions, share feedback, and connect with community and developers (https://discord.gg/concretexyz).
- **Write a Blog article about Concrete:** Use the Rubric provided in Discord to write your article of the week.

If a task is shown as **Locked**, you must perform the required related action first.

### Looking Ahead (Phase 2)

The launch of **Phase 1** leaves the door open for future phases of the Concrete Points Program.

- An Earn App leaderboard related to using the platform will be released at a later date, and will not be part of this initial social campaign.
- Details on the final point conversion ratio and distribution dates for Concrete Points will be announced as the program progresses.
