Exciting rewards are on the way! Concrete Protocol will soon introduce its **Concrete Points Program**, offering users a unique opportunity to earn and benefit from their engagement with our platform.


## Points in Vaults: How They Work

Concrete vaults reward depositors with **points**—a key mechanism for future governance, airdrops, or token allocations. Here's how they work and what happens to your points at the **Token Generation Event (TGE)**.

- Points are earned while you stake
- You don’t need to claim or lock them—they’re captured at TGE
- Claiming your vault rewards does not affect your ability to receive points.
Even after claiming, your points will still be counted and redeemable at TGE.
- These points represent your share of future token rewards

If you have more than one eligible vault position, all points are combined under the same wallet identity.

### How Points Are Earned

While your funds are deposited in a vault, you earn **Concrete Points** continuously over time. The amount you earn depends on:

- **Vault share size** – how much you’ve deposited
- **Time staked** – longer deposits earn more
- **Bonus multipliers** – some vaults (like Bera) may offer higher point rates during specific campaigns

Your points accrue **passively**—you don’t need to claim them manually, stay tuned for more!

### What Happens at TGE?

At the **Token Generation Event (TGE)**, Concrete Points will be used to determine your share of any token allocation.

Concrete’s protocol **automatically captures your point balance** at the time of TGE. You don’t need to take any action to “lock” them beforehand.

- Points are read **from the ctBeraVaultShare** (a soul-bound token linked to your position)
- Your point balance is **recorded and attributed** to your wallet
- Points are then used to calculate your eligible rewards or token distribution


Stay tuned for more details about how you can earn, track, and redeem your points. This page will be updated with comprehensive information about the rewards structure and benefits as the program becomes available.

Keep an eye out for updates!
