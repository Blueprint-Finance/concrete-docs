Concrete’s **Stable Vaults** let you deposit **USDT** or **frxUSD** early to have your funds automatically deployed on the Stable Network from day one.

The **Stable Pendle Looping** **Vault** launches on the same day and is an optional next step — allowing depositors who want higher returns to move their Stable vault position into a looping strategy.

## The Stable Network

**Stable** is an institutional-grade blockchain built for stablecoins, designed to support efficient yield, liquidity, and settlement at scale.

By participating through Concrete vaults, users provide early liquidity and help bootstrap the ecosystem while earning rewards.

## What Are Stable Vaults?

Stable vaults are vaults that collect deposits ahead of the Stable network launch. They let you earn yield once the vault goes live.

After you deposit, you’ll receive **receipt tokens** representing your position — these can later be used to enter the Pendle Looping vault.


:::tip
The Stable vault supports USDT and frxUSD. Rewards will be handled via [Merkl](https://app.merkl.xyz/). Concrete points will be additional to the rewards.

## Rewards

- You’ll earn **Concrete Points** during the campaign
- Any rewards are distributed through **Merkl**
- Boosted reward multipliers may apply to deposits made into the Looping Vault

## Timeline

1. **Deposits Open** — Users can deposit to Stable vaults (October 23, 2025).
2. **Claim** —  Users will claim their vault shares to the Stable Network. During this process, you’ll claim your vault shares on Stable, which **burns** your existing vault shares on Ethereum L1 and **mints** the same number of new shares on the Stable Network.
3. **Withdrawals Enabled** — Once bridging completes, users can enter the withdrawal queue (13 December, 2025).
4. **7-Day Withdrawal Queue** — After initial unlocks, withdrawals follow a standard queue for smooth liquidity management.

:::tip
Any funds left in the Stable vault after migration will continue to earn yield directly on the Stable Network.

## How to Deposit

1. Navigate to the campaign page [stable.concrete.xyz](https://stable.concrete.xyz/)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** and choose your preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
3. Select **USDT** or **frxUSD**
4. Enter the amount of stablecoins that you want to deposit
5. Approve the vault by providing  wallet permission to spend your stablecoin
6. Confirm the deposit by signing the deposit transaction in your wallet
7. After confirmation, you’ll receive **ctStableUSDT** or **ctStablefrxUSD** representing your deposit.

## Bridging Phase

After depositing, the Concrete team will bridge your assets to the Stable network.

During this phase:

- You don’t need to take any action — balances will update automatically once bridging finishes
- Your balance and vault TVL will temporarily be hidden while the bridge completes
- The app will display “Bridging in progress”
- Typical bridging time: maximum of 72 hours

## After Bridging Complete

- Your balance and vault TVL will become visible
- You can see your deposited position under **My Deposits**

## Stable Pendle Looping

**ctStableUSDT** and **ctStablefrxUSD** holders can loop their assets via the Stable Pendle Looping vault for easy access to additional yield.

## Withdrawals

Withdrawals occur **on the Stable Network** once bridging is complete.

- Withdrawal queue opens 13 December 2025
- Once the queue activates, requests are processed in a **7-day withdrawal queue**
- The app will clearly display withdrawal status (“In Queue”, “Processing”, “Ready to Claim”)
- Once processed, your tokens become **claimable** directly from the Earn app

:::tip
When the campaign ends, any remaining vault balances will continue accruing yield until withdrawn.
