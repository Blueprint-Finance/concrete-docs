Concrete’s **Stable Vaults** let you deposit **USDT** or **frxUSD** early to have your funds automatically deployed on the Stable Network from day one.

## The Stable Network

**Stable** is an institutional-grade blockchain built for stablecoins, designed to support efficient yield, liquidity, and settlement at scale.

By participating through Concrete vaults, users provide early liquidity and help bootstrap the ecosystem while earning rewards.

## What Are Stable Vaults?

Stable Vaults are vaults that accept deposits ahead of the Stable Network launch, and they have been earning yield from day one.

After you deposit, you’ll receive **receipt tokens** representing your position.


:::tip
The Stable vault supports USDT and frxUSD. Rewards will be handled via [Merkl](https://app.merkl.xyz/). Concrete points will be additional to the rewards.

## Rewards

- You’ll earn **Concrete Points** during the campaign
- Any rewards are distributed through **Merkl**

:::tip
Check [app.merkl.xyz](https://app.merkl.xyz/) for live reward tracking once the campaign launches

## Timeline

1. **Deposits Open** — Users can deposit to Stable vaults (October 23, 2025).
2. **Claim** —  Users will claim their vault shares to the Stable Network. During this process, you’ll claim your vault shares on Stable, which **burns** your existing vault shares on Ethereum L1 and **mints** the same number of new shares on the Stable Network.
3. **Withdrawals Enabled** — Once bridging completes, users can enter withdrawal queue on December 13th.
4. **7-Day Withdrawal Queue** — After initial unlocks, withdrawals follow a standard queue for smooth liquidity management.

:::tip
Any funds left in the Stable vault after migration will continue to earn yield directly on the Stable Network.
