The **Pendle Looping Vault** is an optional next step for depositors who want to boost their yield during the pre-deposit phase. It hands the vault shares to the curator which splits tokens into pendle PT / YT tokens and loops them by using PT tokens as collateral on a lending market.

Pendle Looping vaults use **looping strategies** to generate higher returns on your stablecoin deposits.

## Prerequisite

You must already hold **Stable receipt tokens** in your wallet (**ctStableUSDT** or **ctStablefrxUSD**).

These tokens represent your early deposit from the Stable Vaults and make you eligible to enter the Looping vault automatically.

## Rewards

- Rewards will be distributed upon withdrawal of the deposit token.
- Users continue to earn **Concrete Points** for the duration of the campaign
- Yield is compounded automatically through Concrete’s strategy engine
- You can track live APY and pending rewards in the vault page

## Timeline

1. **Operations Begin** — Stable vaults (USDT and frxUSD) go live on **October 23, 2025**
2. **Withdrawals Available** — Withdrawals open on **November 21, 2025**
Users can initiate withdrawal requests after bridging completes.
3. **Immediate Withdrawals from Pendle Looping Vaults** — Withdrawals from the Pendle Looping vaults are atomic (instant).
