Concrete is deprecating the **TAC Stone**, **TAC LevelUSD**, and **TAC Renzo** vaults as part of a long-term platform consolidation and upgrade strategy.

If you deposited into these vaults, we recommend redeeming your funds as soon as possible. The vaults will be removed from the app before **October 1st, 2025**. While a fallback recovery option will remain available after deactivation, withdrawing early ensures full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- The TAC Stone, TAC LevelUSD, and TAC Renzo vaults are being removed from the app
- Your funds are safe and withdrawable via the app until **October 1st, 2025**
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- After October 1st, any remaining assets will be moved to a Recovery Vault and still be redeemable via manual support

## What’s Changing?

The following vaults will be deprecated and removed from the Concrete app:

1. **TAC Stone** — Deposit: `uniBTC`
2. **TAC LevelUSD** — Deposit: `lvlUSD`
3. **TAC Renzo** — Deposit: `ezETH`

All affected vaults will be deactivated on October 1st, 2025. After this date, any unclaimed funds will be stored in a Recovery Vault and made available through a manual support process. We recommend withdrawing your funds before deactivation.

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your deposited assets and yield remain secure in audited smart contracts.

You’ll be able to withdraw them using:

- The **Concrete Earn app** — until **October 1st, 2025**
