When withdrawing vault shares, it’s essential to ensure that you control the destination address where assets will be sent.

- Always confirm you control your Berachain address before bridging.
- If not, use the **Request a change** option to avoid losing access to your assets.

This article explains how to request a destination address change if needed.

## How to Request an Address Change

If you’ve lost access to your Berachain address, follow these steps to request a change:

### 1. Contact Support

Start by contacting us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/concretexyz) or via [support@blueprintfinance.com](mailto:support@blueprintfinance.com). Let us know you no longer have access to your Berachain destination address.

### 2. Sign a Message Using Etherscan

a. Go to [https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures#](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures#**) and click on the button “Sign Message”:

  style={{ maxWidth: "800px", width: "100%", height: "auto", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

b. Enter your new Berachain address in the **Message** form field:

<img
  src="/img/change-2.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: "800px", width: "100%", height: "auto", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

c. Sign the message to publish

d. Send the **URL of the published message** to us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/concretexyz) or via [support@blueprintfinance.com](mailto:support@blueprintfinance.com)

### 3. We Verify the Signed Message

Once we receive your message URL, we will:

- Verify that the message was signed and published correctly on Etherscan
- Check that it matches the expected wallet and destination address

### 4. Redemption Status Check

Next, we’ll check if the funds for your original wallet address have already been withdrawn or claimed:

- **If funds have been redeemed**: We won’t proceed. Your wallet will be marked as redeemed.
- **If funds have *not* been redeemed**: We’ll proceed to the final step.

### 5. Update and Fulfill

Our team will:

- Update your data to reflect the new Berachain address
- Send the remaining vault shares and any pending rewards to your new Berachain address

This process may take a few days to complete. You will be notified once it's done.

## Where This Applies

You’ll encounter this ownership validation in:

- **Withdraw flows** from vaults using bridging
- **Reward claiming** that bridges rewards to Berachain
- **Vault transfer** steps involving address movement
