If you participated in the Bera vault and are eligible for rewards, you can claim them via the Concrete Core UI within 3 months of the unlock date.

## Claim Window

- You have **3 months** from **May 6th** to claim your rewards and funds
- All unclaimed rewards or funds will be kept safe
- We will create an alternative way for depositors to get their unclaimed rewards or funds before we disable the Withdrawals and Claims in our UI

## Why This Matters

Unclaimed tokens sitting idle create administrative overhead. To maintain fairness and vault efficiency, Concrete sets a clear deadline for claims.

Claiming is quick and only requires a signature from your connected wallet.
