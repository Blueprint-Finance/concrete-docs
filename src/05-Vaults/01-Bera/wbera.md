**Wrapped BERA (WBERA)** is the wrapped ERC-20 version of the native BERA token on Berachain. Wrapping BERA allows users to interact with DeFi protocols that require ERC-20 compatibility, including vaults, swaps, and on-chain strategies.

## Why Wrap BERA?

Many Berachain-based DeFi tools and vaults are built for ERC-20 tokens. Wrapping your BERA into WBERA ensures seamless integration with:

- **Concrete Vaults** that require ERC-20 assets
- **Liquidity pools** and AMMs
- **Staking contracts and strategy protocols**

## How to Get WBERA

You can wrap BERA into WBERA directly via:

- **Berachain native interfaces**
- **Concrete vault deposit flows** (if wrapping is required, the UI will guide you)

:::tip
Wrapping does not affect your ownership â€” WBERA is fully backed 1:1 by BERA and can be unwrapped at any time.
