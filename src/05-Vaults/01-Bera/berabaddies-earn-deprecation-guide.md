Concrete is deprecating the **Berabaddies Earn vaults** as part of a long-term platform consolidation and upgrade strategy.

If you deposited into these vaults, we recommend redeeming your funds as soon as possible. The vaults will be removed from the app before October 1st, 2025. While a fallback recovery option will remain available after deactivation, withdrawing early ensures full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- The Berabaddies Earn vaults are being removed from the app
- Your funds are safe and withdrawable via the app until October 1st, 2025
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- After October 1st, any remaining funds will be moved to a Recovery Vault and will still be redeemable via manual support

## What’s Changing?

The following vaults will be deprecated and removed from the Concrete app:

1. **Berabaddies HONEY** — Deposit: HONEY
2. **Berabaddies BERA** — Deposit: WBERA

:::tip
All affected vaults will be deactivated on October 1, 2025. From that date, any remaining funds will be stored in the Recovery Vault, where users can claim them through a manual support process. We recommend withdrawing your funds before deactivation.

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your funds and earned yield are safely stored in audited smart contracts. You will be able to access them using:

- The Concrete Earn app — until October 1st, 2025
