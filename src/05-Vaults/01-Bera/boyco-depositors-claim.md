If you deposited into a [Concrete vault](https://app.concrete.xyz/vault/berachain/boyco/0xf0d94806e6E5cB54336ED0f8De459659718F149C) through Boyco, your rewards and positions are now available directly on the **Boyco app**.

## Where to Claim

To access your vault position or claim rewards, navigate to [**Boyco Claim Portal**](https://berachain.royco.org/portfolio).

Once you connect your wallet, you’ll see your eligible Concrete vault positions and can:

- View your current holdings
- Claim unlocked rewards (Concrete Points or partner tokens)
- Withdraw funds (if the cooldown period has ended)

## Why Claim Happens on Boyco

Boyco acts as a front-end layer for Concrete vaults. If your original deposit was routed through Boyco, then **your ctTokens and rewards are only visible through Boyco’s interface**, not directly on Concrete.

## Important Notes

- **You’ll need to use the same wallet** that made the original deposit.
- **Withdraw Queue** may apply before withdrawal (up to 72 hours).
- You’ll still earn **Concrete Points** and partner rewards just like other vault depositors.

:::tip
If you're unsure whether you used Boyco, try connecting your wallet on both platforms. If your vault position appears on Boyco, you should continue managing it there.
