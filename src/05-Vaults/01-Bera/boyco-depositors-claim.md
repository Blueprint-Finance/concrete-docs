If you deposited into a Concrete vault through Boyco, your rewards and positions are now available directly on the **Boyco app**.

## Where to Claim

Claiming your vault position is a **two-step process**:

1. **Navigate to the Boyco Claim Portal:**

   * Go to [Boyco Claim Portal](https://berachain.royco.org/portfolio)
   * Connect your wallet.
   * Here, you will receive **ctTokens** representing your vault position.

2. **Claim Your Position on Concrete:**

   * Once you have received your ctTokens, proceed to the [Concrete Boyco Vault Claim Page](https://app.concrete.xyz/vault/berachain/boyco/0xf0d94806e6E5cB54336ED0f8De459659718F149C).
   * This is where you can claim your vault position and withdraw any eligible rewards (Concrete Points or partner tokens).

## Why Claim Happens on Boyco

Boyco acts as a front-end layer for Concrete vaults. If your original deposit was routed through Boyco, then **your ctTokens and rewards are only visible through Boyco’s interface**, not directly on Concrete.

## Important Notes

- Use the same wallet that made the original deposit.
- If you're unsure whether you used Boyco, try connecting your wallet on both platforms. If your vault position appears on Boyco, you should continue managing it there.
- Withdraw queue may apply before withdrawal (up to 72 hours).
- You’ll still earn Concrete Points and partner rewards just like other vault depositors.
