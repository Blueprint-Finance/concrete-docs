Concrete is deprecating the **Bera Vaults** as part of a long-term platform consolidation and upgrade strategy.

If you deposited into these vaults, we recommend redeeming your funds promptly. While withdrawals remain open, withdrawing early ensures you keep full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- Deposits are disabled and the vault moves into **atomic withdrawals mode on 29 of August**.
- Any remaining balances no longer earn yield but remain fully withdrawable through the Concrete App.
- Your funds are safe and remain withdrawable at any time with **atomic withdrawals enabled**.
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- No fees are charged on balances after depreciation

## What’s Changing?

The following vaults will be deprecated:

- **WBERA** — Deposit: Closed
- **USDT0** — Deposit: Closed
- **USDC.e** — Deposit: Closed
- **HONEY** — Deposit: Closed
- **uniBTC** — Deposit: Closed
- **FBTC** — Deposit: Closed

These vaults will:

- Stop accepting deposits as of August 27, 2025.
- Allow atomic withdrawals through the Concrete App as of August 29, 2025.

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your deposited assets and yield are secure in smart contracts. You’ll be able to withdraw them using:

- The Concrete app (until vaults are removed)
- A manual support process (for users returning after vaults have been disabled on the UI)

## What You Need to Do

### Withdraw Now

If the vault is still active in the app:

1. Visit [Concrete App](https://app.concrete.xyz/)
2. Go to your relevant Bera Vault
3. Navigate to the **Withdraw** tab
4. Click **Withdraw** and follow the wallet prompt
