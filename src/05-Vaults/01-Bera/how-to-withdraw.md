If you're ready to exit your position or redeem your rewards, Bera vaults support **secure and scheduled withdrawals**. This guide walks you through how to withdraw and what to expect during the **72-hour withdrawal queue**.

## Understanding the 72-Hour Withdrawal Queue

When you withdraw from a Bera vault, your request enters a **withdrawal queue**.

**Withdrawals are not instant.** Funds are made available after a **72-hour period**, once the request is processed. It applies to all Bera vault withdrawals.

## How to Withdraw

1. Select your Bera vault position from the [Portfolio](https://app.concrete.xyz/portfolio/vaults)
2. If you hold more than one asset in a given vault, select the relevant ct Vault Share
3. Click Bridge to bridge all vault shares to Berachain
4. Upon bridging, you can then withdraw. Review the assets to withdraw
5. Withdraw the assets on Berachain

Once submitted, your request will show as **Queued** and automatically move to **Processing** and then **Available** when the 72-hour period is complete.

## Withdrawal Statuses

- **Queued**: Your request is in the cooldown window
- **Processing**: Backend systems are preparing the withdrawal
- **Available**: Your funds are ready to claim to your wallet

Youâ€™ll receive prompts in the interface when your withdrawal is ready.
