Bera vaults offer an option to **claim your rewards** and transfer your underlying tokens to a new Bera vault, so you can continue to earn an attractive yield plus Bera Governance Token emissions (BGT). All new vaults will have withdrawals open from May 16 onwards.

- To take advantage of this Claim and Transfer, connect your wallet and you will see a banner which informs you of a destination vault based on your deposited tokens.
- Rewards claiming will happen instantly
- Transferring the underlying enters into a 72 hour queue
- Choose **“Claim and Transfer”** in the UI to begin this process

For long-term stakers, transferring is a powerful way to boost returns while minimizing effort.

## 72-Hour Transfer Queue

Just like withdrawals, transferring in Bera vaults is subject to a **72-hour transfer queue**.

When you submit a transfer request:

- Your rewards are queued for transferring
- After **72 hours**, they are automatically deposited into the vault
- You do **not** need to take additional action

This ensures smooth batch processing and supports backend syncing across chains.

## How to Use the Claim and Transfer Function

1. Go to the [Concrete Core app](https://app.concrete.xyz/)
2. Connect your wallet. If you have the relevant vault shares for Bera chain, you will see a banner which reads “Claim Rewards and Keep Earning”
3. Click **Claim and Transfer**
4. Review your rewards to claim
5. Click **Claim and Proceed**
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet
7. Review your vault shares to transfer to the new vault
8. Click Transfer Vault Shares
9. Approve the transaction in your wallet
10. Once confirmed, your request enters the **transfer queue** and will execute after 72 hours.

:::tip
If you have multiple Bera vault shares, all your claimable rewards will be claimed in one transaction.
