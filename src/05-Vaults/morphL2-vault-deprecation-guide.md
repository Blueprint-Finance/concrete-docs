Concrete is deprecating all vaults built on the **Morph Layer 2 network** as part of a long-term platform consolidation and upgrade strategy.

If you deposited into any MorphL2 vault, we recommend redeeming your funds promptly. These vaults are being deprecated and will soon be removed from the app. While a recovery option will remain available after deactivation (as a backup option), withdrawing early ensures you keep full control of your assets and helps reduce delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- MorphL2 vaults are being removed from the app
- Your funds are safe and still withdrawable
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- Withdraw early through the app before October 1st, 2025. After that date, any remaining assets will move to a recovery vault and will still be redeemable.

## What’s Changing?

All vaults built on the **Morph Layer 2** network will be deprecated. These vaults will:

- Stop accepting deposits
- Immediate withdrawals will remain fully available through the app until October 1st, 2025.
- Enter a long-term withdrawal-only mode via the Recovery Vault system

**Affected Vaults:**

1. **Morph BGB** — Deposit: BGB
2. **Morph AUSD** — Deposit: AUSD
3. **Morph Ethena** — Deposit: USDe, sUSDe
4. **Morph Majors** — Deposit: USDC, WETH, USDT, WBTC
5. **Morph weETH** — Deposit: weETH

:::tip
All MorphL2 vaults will be deactivated on October 1st, 2025. From that date, a 1-year withdrawal window begins. We recommend withdrawing your funds before deactivation.

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your deposited assets and yield are secure in smart contracts. You’ll be able to withdraw them using:

- The Concrete Earn app (until vaults are removed)
- A manual support process (for users returning much later)

## What You Need to Do

### Withdraw Now

If the vault is still active in the app:

1. Visit [Concrete App](https://app.concrete.xyz/)
2. Go to the **Portfolio** tab
3. Select your MorphL2 vault position
4. Click **Withdraw** and follow the wallet prompt
