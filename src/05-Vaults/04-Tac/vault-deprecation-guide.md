The **TAC Stone**, **TAC LevelUSD**, and **TAC Renzo** vaults are live on [Turtle.xyz](https://app.turtle.xyz/campaigns/tac). As part of the deprecation process, the withdrawal instructions steps are now hosted on [Concrete.xyz](https://app.concrete.xyz/earn).

If you deposited into these vaults, we recommend redeeming your funds promptly. While withdrawals remain open, withdrawing early ensures you keep full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- Your funds are safe and withdrawable via the app
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- **TAC rewards are managed by Merkl** — they are now unlocked and fully claimable via [app.merkl.xyz/users](https://app.merkl.xyz/users)

## What’s Changing?

The following vaults will be deprecated:

1. **TAC Stone** — Deposit: `uniBTC`
2. **TAC LevelUSD** — Deposit: `lvlUSD`
3. **TAC Renzo** — Deposit: `ezETH`

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your deposited assets and yield remain secure in audited smart contracts.

You’ll be able to withdraw them using:

- The Concrete app (until vaults are removed)
- A manual support process (for users returning after vaults have been disabled on the UI)
