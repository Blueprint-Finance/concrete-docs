The **TAC Stone**, **TAC LevelUSD**, and **TAC Renzo** vaults are live on [Turtle.xyz](https://app.turtle.xyz/campaigns/tac) and never appeared in the Concrete app before. As part of the deprecation process, the withdrawal instructions, and recovery steps are now hosted on [Concrete.xyz](https://app.concrete.xyz/earn).

If you deposited into these vaults, we recommend redeeming your funds as soon as possible. These vaults will remain visible in the UI but will be marked as **Completed** after **October 1st, 2025**. While a fallback recovery option will remain available after deactivation, withdrawing early ensures full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

- Your funds are safe and withdrawable via the app until **October 1st, 2025**
- The TAC Stone, TAC LevelUSD, and TAC Renzo vaults will remain visible but will be marked as **Completed** after **October 1st, 2025**
- Rewards already earned will remain claimable
- **TAC rewards are managed by Merkl** — they are now unlocked and fully claimable via [app.merkl.xyz/users](https://app.merkl.xyz/users)

All affected vaults will be deactivated on October 1st, 2025. After this date, any unclaimed funds will be stored in a Recovery Vault and made available through a manual support process. We recommend withdrawing your funds before deactivation.
