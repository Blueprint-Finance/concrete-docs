As part of a long-term strategy to consolidate and upgrade the platform, **Concrete** deprecates vaults when the campaign ends.

When a vault enters **deprecation**, it transitions into **atomic withdrawal–only mode**. This ensures a smooth and secure exit process for all users.

If you deposited into a vault listed below, we recommend redeeming your funds promptly. While withdrawals remain open, withdrawing early ensures you keep full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

What deprecation means for you:

- Deposits are permanently disabled
- No fees are charged after deprecation
- Any remaining balances no longer earn yield
- All funds can be redeemed through atomic withdrawals
- Previously earned rewards stay claimable
