As part of a long-term strategy to consolidate and upgrade the platform, **Concrete** deprecates vaults when their campaigns end.

When a vault enters **deprecation**, it begins a **controlled wind-down process**.

Depending on the vault’s structure and underlying strategy, **different mechanisms may be used to make funds available to depositors**, including:
* Enabling async withdrawals
* Enabling atomic withdrawals
* Airdropping assets directly to depositors

Concrete vaults transition to **withdraw-only mode** during deprecation. For vaults hosted in partnership and displayed on the Concrete website, please visit the partner’s site for details about their specific deprecation process.

If you deposited into any of the vaults [listed below](#deprecation-log), we recommend **redeeming your funds promptly** or contacting the vault curator for guidance. Withdrawing early from deprecated vaults ensures you retain full control over your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

What deprecation means for you:

- Deposits are permanently disabled
- No new fees accrue after deprecation
- Remaining balances stop earning yield
- Withdrawal paths depend on the vault type
- Previously earned rewards remain claimable

## What You Need to Do

**Withdraw now**:

1. Visit the [Concrete App](https://app.concrete.xyz/)
2. Go to your relevant vault
3. Open the **Withdraw** tab
4. Click **Withdraw** and follow the wallet prompt

For **vaults hosted in partnership** and displayed on the Concrete website, please visit the partner’s site for details about their specific deprecation process.
