As part of a long-term strategy to consolidate and upgrade the platform, **Concrete** deprecates vaults when the campaign ends.

When a vault enters **deprecation**, it transitions into **atomic withdrawal–only mode**. This ensures a smooth and secure exit process for all users.

If you deposited into a vault listed below, we recommend redeeming your funds promptly. While withdrawals remain open, withdrawing early ensures you keep full control of your assets and helps avoid delays.

## Summary for Depositors

What deprecation means for you:

- Deposits are permanently disabled
- No fees are charged after deprecation
- Any remaining balances no longer earn yield
- All funds can be redeemed through atomic withdrawals
- Previously earned rewards stay claimable

## What You Need to Do

**Withdraw now —** with atomic withdrawals enabled, you can exit instantly:

1. Visit the [Concrete App](https://app.concrete.xyz/)
2. Go to your relevant vault
3. Open the **Withdraw** tab
4. Click **Withdraw** and follow the wallet prompt

## Are My Funds Safe?

Yes. Your deposited assets and yield are secure in smart contracts. You’ll be able to withdraw them using:

- The Concrete app
- A manual support process (for users returning after vaults have been disabled on the UI)
